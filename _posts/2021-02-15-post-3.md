Long time no post! Ive been busy exploring figma prototyping, flutter and dart! Also, finishing off some bits on html and css. I'm excited to start programming properly and really get stuck into my first language, Javascript. So far, I've made a rock paper scissors game and, well, that's about it... I'll let you know in a bit how I get on :)
